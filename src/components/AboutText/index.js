    <p className='about-text-paragraph'>Hi! I'm Flor. A visual artist and web developer from Buenos Aires.<br />
    I currently work as a full stack javascript dev at <a href='http://www.democraciaenred.org' className='about-text-link' target='_blank'>Democracia en Red Foundation</a>.
    Our core project is <a href='https://github.com/DemocracyOS/democracyos' className='about-text-link' target='_blank'>DemocracyOS</a>, but we also make implementations for different governments in Argentina. I use Javascript and several tools as React, Next, Node.js, Express and MongoDB on a daily basis.<br />
    I also enjoy textile arts like embroidery, quilting, knitting. I like to keep my hands busy and make cute stuff.</p>
