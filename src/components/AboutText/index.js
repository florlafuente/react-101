    I currently work as a full stack javascript dev at Democracia en Red Foundation.
    Our core project is DemocracyOS, but we also make implementations for different governments in Argentina.<br />
    I also enjoy textile arts like embroidery, quilting, knitting. I like to keep my hands busy and to make cute stuff</p>
